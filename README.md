ssr demo with nextjs

# what's inside

## branches:
* __version-1__ - poor client-side application with poor UX and low FCP rate
* __master__ client-side application with improvement of FCP 
* __version-next__ - nextjs setup for the basic app... out of the box solution which is built on top of `master` branch
* __version-next-improvements__ - next js sample setup for SSR with usage of `getInitialProps` and `_document.js`. can be
then safely improved to a usage with next/dynamic or next/link so as to demonstrate code splitting and nextjs route system.

## documentation
next js has easy to use docs. it has build-in learning system. do give it a chance: https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started
